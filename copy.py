# Function to copy elements of an array around.

# Copy elements of array a starting at
# i1 and ending just before j1. After
# the copy, these elements should
# reside starting at i2. Invariant:
# there should be sufficient space after i2
# for the copy to complete. Optional invariant:
# Copied elements should also be preserved in
# the source position where possible.
